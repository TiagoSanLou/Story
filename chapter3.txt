The red truck suddenly brakes, I almost hit it, but manage to stop right behind it. I feel sweat pouring down my forehead.
I start to regret having gone this far. A woman steps out the car, she looks so angry.
I discreetly try to reach my gun in the glove compartment, but she's arrives at my window first, gesturing for me to roll it down.
As I slowly roll down the window, she raises her hands to show she's not trying to threaten me.
I'm sorry, she says, I have anger issues and this has gotten a bit out of hand. 
I laugh, we shake hands and part ways.
THE END.
